# A web for a friend's wedding.

![JSA](JSA-web.png)

This is a personal project from 2015. I wanted to create a website for a couple of good friends that were getting married in 2015. I still did not know much about making websites, so I had to figure out how to add a comments section and a RSVP form, both working with PHP. It also had an instagram gallery that showed public photos tagged with their own hashtag.
I designed the whole thing, including the graphics. I put a lot of time an effort on this project and I even made it responsive. Unfortunately they wanted something different and I ended up designing another site.
