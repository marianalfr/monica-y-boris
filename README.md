# A web for a friend's wedding.

![MYB-home](MYB.png)

This is a personal project from 2014. I wanted to create a website for a couple of good friends that were getting married in 2015. The idea was that the guests could have all the information on the site, with directions to both the church and the reception, the wedding list, and some other features like a guest book and RSVP.
I still did not know much about making websites, so I had to figure out how to add the comments section and the RSVP form, both working with PHP. It also had an instagram gallery that showed public photos tagged with their own hashtag.
I designed the whole thing, including the graphics. I put a lot of time an effort on this project and I even made it responsive. Unfortunately, before I could finish it, they told me they wanted something different and I ended up designing [another site](https://github.com/marianalfr/a-website-for-a-wedding).
